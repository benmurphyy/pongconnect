This is a simple multiplayer love2d pong game I made for fun, where two players can play over the internet. Adapted from the CS50 game dev course project 1 on pong.

Set the ip address of the player who will be the server in main.lua file. Also make sure that the player who will be the server has port forwarding on their router for the port 12345 to their device(or any other port, just change as desired).

Afterwards just zip the files into a .love file, and open the game on both computers.

Follow the steps displayed in the game to connect to the other player and start playing!

Enjoy!
